# helloWorld

Hello, World is an interactive simulation that encourages collaboration between users while simultaneously increasing awareness about the importance of environmental preservation. Using modern technology and interactive collaboration, Hello, World is an engaging experience for users of all ages. It gives people an opportunity to experience Earth in a simple, abstract way, thus raising awareness of just how delicate our world is. As a developer on the team my role my main focus was to develop the iPad controls as well as help out with any other development needs.
